# Epic 5: Performance & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Optimize the platform for production scale, implement comprehensive monitoring and error handling, and establish the infrastructure needed to support the growth targets of 1,000 concurrent users and $50K MRR. This epic transforms the functional platform into an enterprise-grade service capable of reliable operation at scale while maintaining the high-quality user experience that drives conversions.

## Story 5.1: Performance Optimization & Scaling

As a platform,  
I want to handle 1,000 concurrent planning sessions without performance degradation,  
so that user growth doesn't compromise the planning experience quality.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Load testing infrastructure capable of simulating 1,000+ concurrent planning sessions
2. Database query optimization with indexing and connection pooling for high-concurrency workloads
3. Redis caching optimization with cluster configuration for session state scaling
4. CDN optimization for frontend assets with global edge distribution
5. LLM API request queuing and rate limiting to manage provider quotas efficiently
6. Auto-scaling infrastructure configuration responding to load metrics
7. Performance monitoring with sub-3-second page load times maintained under peak load

## Story 5.2: Production Monitoring & Alerting

As a platform operator,  
I want comprehensive monitoring of system health and user experience,  
so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Application performance monitoring with real-time metrics and alerting
2. Error tracking and reporting with automated notification for critical issues
3. User experience monitoring including planning session success rates and completion times
4. LLM provider monitoring with automatic failover triggers and cost tracking
5. Infrastructure monitoring for server resources, database performance, and network latency
6. Business metrics monitoring including conversion rates, revenue, and user engagement
7. Automated alerting with escalation procedures for different severity levels

## Story 5.3: Advanced Error Handling & Recovery

As a user,  
I want the platform to gracefully handle errors and recover my session,  
so that technical issues don't cause me to lose planning progress or experience frustration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive error boundary implementation preventing full application crashes
2. LLM API failure handling with automatic retry logic and fallback provider switching
3. Session recovery mechanisms that restore conversation state after connection interruptions
4. User-friendly error messages with clear next steps and support contact information
5. Automatic session backup with point-in-time recovery capabilities
6. Network connectivity handling with offline mode support for session continuation
7. Data integrity validation ensuring planning documents remain consistent during errors

## Story 5.4: Security & Compliance Infrastructure

As a business,  
I want enterprise-grade security and compliance measures,  
so that users trust the platform with their sensitive project planning data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. SOC 2 Type II compliance preparation with security controls documentation
2. Data encryption at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols
3. User data privacy controls with GDPR compliance for European users
4. Security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing procedures
5. Access logging and audit trails for all user data and system operations
6. Secure backup and disaster recovery procedures with tested restoration processes
7. Security incident response procedures with user notification protocols

## Story 5.5: Operational Excellence & DevOps

As a development team,  
I want streamlined deployment and operational procedures,  
so that we can rapidly iterate while maintaining system stability and reliability.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Blue-green deployment strategy enabling zero-downtime updates
2. Automated testing pipeline with comprehensive coverage before production deployment
3. Feature flag management allowing safe rollout of new capabilities to user subsets
4. Database migration procedures with rollback capabilities and zero-downtime execution
5. Environment parity ensuring development, staging, and production consistency
6. Automated backup verification and disaster recovery testing procedures
7. Documentation and runbooks for common operational tasks and incident response

## Story 5.6: Advanced Analytics & Business Intelligence

As a business stakeholder,  
I want deep insights into user behavior and business performance,  
so that I can make data-driven decisions for product development and growth strategy.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Advanced user segmentation and cohort analysis for understanding conversion patterns
2. Planning session quality metrics including document usefulness and user satisfaction scores
3. Competitive analysis tracking comparing user outcomes with traditional planning methods
4. Revenue forecasting models based on user acquisition and retention patterns
5. Product usage analytics identifying most valuable features and optimization opportunities
6. Market analysis capabilities tracking industry trends and user feedback themes
7. Executive dashboard with key business metrics and growth indicators for stakeholder reporting
