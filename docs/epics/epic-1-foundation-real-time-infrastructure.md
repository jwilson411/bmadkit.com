# Epic 1: Foundation & Real-time Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational project infrastructure including authentication, database setup, and real-time communication capabilities while delivering an immediately functional project input interface that demonstrates core value to users. This epic creates the technical foundation and delivers the first touchpoint where users can input their project ideas and receive intelligent responses.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

As a developer,  
I want a properly configured full-stack project with CI/CD pipeline,  
so that the team can develop and deploy features reliably from day one.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/Express) applications
2. PostgreSQL database configured with Prisma ORM and initial schema
3. Redis instance configured for session caching
4. Environment configuration for local development, staging, and production
5. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment
6. Health check endpoints implemented and accessible
7. HTTPS and security headers configured for production deployment

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a potential user,  
I want to create an account and login securely,  
so that I can save my planning sessions and access premium features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. JWT-based authentication system implemented with secure token generation
2. User registration with email validation functionality
3. Login/logout functionality with proper session management
4. Password reset capability via email
5. User profile basic CRUD operations
6. Authentication middleware for protected routes
7. Frontend authentication state management with persistent sessions

## Story 1.3: Real-time Communication Infrastructure

As a user,  
I want real-time updates during my planning session,  
so that I can see progress as my AI team works on my project.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. WebSocket server implementation using Socket.IO
2. Client-side real-time connection management with automatic reconnection
3. Real-time message broadcasting system for session updates
4. Connection state management and error handling
5. Rate limiting and connection security measures
6. Basic real-time event types defined (progress, document_update, agent_status)
7. Real-time connection testing and monitoring endpoints

## Story 1.4: Project Input Interface

As a user,  
I want to input my project idea and receive an intelligent response,  
so that I can immediately see the value of the planning platform.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Clean, responsive landing page with aspirational messaging ("Start making your dreams a reality")
2. Simple text input interface for project ideas with character limit and validation
3. Basic project idea processing that generates intelligent follow-up questions
4. Initial conversation state management and persistence
5. Responsive design working across desktop and tablet devices
6. Basic error handling for failed submissions or network issues
7. Anonymous user support for immediate value demonstration
