# BMAD Web UI Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable non-technical users to conduct comprehensive project planning using the BMAD methodology through an intuitive web interface
- Transform the BMAD method from a CLI tool into a scalable SaaS platform serving teams and paying customers
- Position users as managers of an "AI expert team" that delivers professional-grade planning documents in 45 minutes
- Achieve $50K MRR within 12 months through freemium model with progressive value unlocks
- Establish market leadership in AI-powered project planning tools
- Deliver compressed expertise that prevents AI project failures through proper upfront planning

### Background Context
The BMAD methodology has proven effective for comprehensive project planning but remains limited to technical users due to its command-line interface requirements. With the rapid adoption of AI development tools, there's a critical market gap - teams can now build faster than ever, but without proper planning, they build the wrong things. The platform addresses this by orchestrating existing BMAD agent workflows through an intuitive web interface, allowing users to feel like they're managing their own AI consulting team rather than using a software tool. This timing aligns perfectly with the growing demand for accessible project planning expertise in the AI development boom.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The interface embodies the "AI team management" paradigm where users feel like they're directing their own consulting team rather than using a software tool. The experience begins with an aspirational hook ("Start making your dreams a reality") followed by intelligent conversation flow that adapts to user expertise level. Real-time document generation creates a "Planning Theater" where users watch their comprehensive planning documents build progressively, transforming waiting time into anticipation and perceived value.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Planning Interface:** Natural language input with intelligent follow-up questions that demonstrate guided discovery value
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Information and features revealed based on user engagement and payment tier (free → email → paid)  
- **Real-time Document Streaming:** Live preview of generated documents (PRD, architecture) updating as AI agents work
- **Team Status Updates:** Contextual messages like "Your AI Project Manager is analyzing market positioning..." to reinforce the team management experience
- **Milestone Progression:** Visual indicators showing completion of major planning phases without traditional progress bars

### Core Screens and Views
- **Landing Page:** Aspirational messaging with immediate project input field
- **Planning Session Interface:** Conversational UI with real-time document preview panel
- **Document Preview Dashboard:** Live-updating view of all generated planning artifacts
- **Export & Download Center:** Access to completed documents in multiple formats
- **Account Management:** Subscription, billing, and project history for paid users
- **Session Resume Interface:** Return to incomplete planning sessions with full context

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including proper keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### Branding
Clean, professional aesthetic that conveys expertise and trustworthiness. Visual design should reinforce the "compressed expertise" positioning through sophisticated typography and layout. Real-time document generation should feel impressive and valuable, not overwhelming. Color palette and styling should differentiate the platform from basic project management tools while maintaining approachability for non-technical users.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop and tablet use where comprehensive planning documents are most effectively reviewed and edited. Mobile compatibility for basic session initiation, but primary experience designed for larger screens where document preview and conversational interface can coexist effectively.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Rationale:** Monorepo structure supports shared types and utilities between frontend and backend while maintaining clear separation. Aligns with modern development practices for full-stack applications and simplifies deployment coordination for real-time features requiring frontend/backend synchronization.

- RESTful API endpoints for session management and document CRUD operations
- WebSocket services for real-time document streaming and progress updates  
- Orchestration service managing BMAD agent workflow execution
- Session state management via Redis cache with PostgreSQL persistence
- Microservices pattern for agent execution to enable independent scaling and LLM provider failover

### Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL DECISION - Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive testing strategy including:
- Unit tests for individual agent orchestration logic and document generation
- Integration tests for LLM API interactions and workflow sequencing
- End-to-end testing for complete planning session flows
