# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable non-technical users to conduct comprehensive project planning using the BMAD methodology through an intuitive web interface
- Transform the BMAD method from a CLI tool into a scalable SaaS platform serving teams and paying customers
- Position users as managers of an "AI expert team" that delivers professional-grade planning documents in 45 minutes
- Achieve $50K MRR within 12 months through freemium model with progressive value unlocks
- Establish market leadership in AI-powered project planning tools
- Deliver compressed expertise that prevents AI project failures through proper upfront planning

## Background Context
The BMAD methodology has proven effective for comprehensive project planning but remains limited to technical users due to its command-line interface requirements. With the rapid adoption of AI development tools, there's a critical market gap - teams can now build faster than ever, but without proper planning, they build the wrong things. The platform addresses this by orchestrating existing BMAD agent workflows through an intuitive web interface, allowing users to feel like they're managing their own AI consulting team rather than using a software tool. This timing aligns perfectly with the growing demand for accessible project planning expertise in the AI development boom.
