### Security Review

**HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:**

- **PCI Compliance**: Proper Stripe tokenization implementation critical - no raw card data storage
- **Webhook Security**: Stripe signature verification must be implemented correctly to prevent spoofing
- **Rate Limiting**: Payment endpoints require aggressive rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Data Encryption**: All payment-related data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Payment operations require elevated authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive payment event logging required for compliance and fraud detection

### Performance Considerations

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Payment Processing Latency**: Target <3s for payment confirmation to maintain user experience
- **Webhook Processing**: Must handle high-volume webhook events without blocking
- **Database Performance**: Payment queries and updates need optimization for high concurrency
- **Cache Strategy**: Payment status and subscription data caching for improved performance
- **Queue Management**: Failed payment retry queues need monitoring and performance tuning

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during pre-implementation review.
