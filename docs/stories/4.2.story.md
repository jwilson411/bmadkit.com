# Story 4.2: Premium Feature Management

**Status:** Draft  
**Epic:** 4 - Monetization & Export Platform  
**Story Points:** 6  
**Priority:** High  

## Story

As a platform,  
I want to control access to premium features based on user subscription status,  
so that I can monetize advanced capabilities while maintaining free tier value.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Feature flagging system that controls access to premium capabilities
2. Advanced planning sessions with longer duration and more detailed questioning
3. Priority processing with faster response times and dedicated infrastructure resources
4. Extended document templates including technical architecture and implementation roadmaps
5. Session history with unlimited storage and advanced search capabilities
6. Custom branding options for exported documents (enterprise feature)
7. Premium user identification and special handling throughout the platform

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Pre-implementation architectural review of premium feature management system. Story demonstrates strong understanding of subscription tier enforcement and feature flagging requirements. The three-tier approach (FREE, EMAIL_CAPTURED, PREMIUM) provides clear monetization progression. Architecture properly addresses feature access control, resource allocation, and premium user experience differentiation.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring performed as this is a pre-implementation review.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⏳ (Pre-implementation - will validate during development)
- Project Structure: ✓ File locations follow established architecture patterns  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test requirements defined including load testing
- All ACs Met: ⏳ (Pre-implementation - ready for development)

### Improvements Checklist

[Pre-implementation recommendations for development team]

- [ ] Design feature flag performance optimization strategy with Redis caching
- [ ] Implement subscription tier middleware with JWT claims validation  
- [ ] Create premium processing queue monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Add advanced search optimization for unlimited session history
- [ ] Implement template versioning and access control system
- [ ] Create feature flag rollout and A/B testing capabilities
- [ ] Add premium user analytics and engagement tracking
- [ ] Implement custom branding preview and validation tools

### Security Review

**MEDIUM PRIORITY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:**

- **Feature Flag Manipulation**: Ensure feature flag evaluation cannot be bypassed or manipulated
- **Subscription Tier Validation**: JWT claims validation must be tamper-proof and regularly refreshed
- **Premium Resource Access**: Prevent unauthorized access to premium processing resources
- **Session Data Protection**: Unlimited storage requires proper data encryption and access controls
- **Custom Branding Security**: Prevent XSS and injection attacks through custom branding inputs

### Performance Considerations

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Feature Flag Evaluation**: Target <10ms for feature flag resolution with Redis caching
- **Premium Queue Processing**: Dedicated infrastructure must maintain SLA performance guarantees
- **Session History Search**: Advanced search on unlimited history requires indexing and query optimization
- **Template Processing**: Premium templates may be more complex requiring performance monitoring
- **Custom Branding Rendering**: Dynamic branding must not impact page load performance

### Files Modified During Review
