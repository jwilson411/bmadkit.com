2. Real-time document compilation from conversation history and agent outputs
3. Markdown document generation with proper formatting and structure
4. Document state management with version tracking
5. Basic document preview functionality accessible to user
6. Document content updating as conversation progresses
7. Error handling for document generation failures with user notification

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**MAJOR FINDING:** This story is currently in Draft status with no implementation code present. The document generation functionality is critical for demonstrating value to users during the 45-minute planning session. The expected packages/api/src/ structure with document services, templates, and compilation logic does not exist.

**Story Readiness:** Detailed requirements and comprehensive task breakdown exist, but missing:
- Document generation service implementations
- BMAD template conversions to Handlebars format
- Document compilation and real-time update logic
- WebSocket integration for live document streaming
- File List section documenting completed work
- Status update to "Review"

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as no implementation code exists.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⚠️ Cannot assess - no code exists
- Project Structure: ⚠️ Expected document generation structure not implemented
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ No tests exist to evaluate
- All ACs Met: ✗ No implementation to verify against ACs

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage Gaps:**
- AC1: Document template engine - No BMAD template conversion or Handlebars processing exists
- AC2: Real-time document compilation - No conversation-to-document mapping implemented
- AC3: Markdown generation - No markdown rendering or formatting logic exists
- AC4: Document state management - No versioning or state tracking implemented
- AC5: Document preview functionality - No preview API or WebSocket integration exists
- AC6: Progressive document updates - No incremental update logic implemented
- AC7: Error handling - No generation failure handling or user notification exists

**Critical Risk Assessment:**
- **VALUE DEMONSTRATION RISK:** No document generation threatens user value perception
- **REAL-TIME REQUIREMENT RISK:** WebSocket integration critical for user engagement
- **TEMPLATE COMPLEXITY RISK:** BMAD template conversion requires careful handling
- **PERFORMANCE RISK:** Real-time compilation could impact system responsiveness
- **INTEGRATION RISK:** Dependencies on conversation history and agent outputs

### Security Review

**Critical Security Concerns:**
- Document template processing could enable template injection attacks
- User conversation data needs secure handling during document generation
- Generated documents may contain sensitive planning information requiring protection
- WebSocket document streaming lacks authentication and authorization
- Template engine execution risks if user input not properly sanitized

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Risks Identified:**
- Real-time document compilation overhead during conversations
- Template processing performance with complex conversation contexts
- WebSocket streaming efficiency for large documents
- Document versioning storage growth and cleanup needs
- Incremental compilation optimization requirements

### Files Modified During Review

None - no implementation files exist.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.5-basic-document-generation.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to user value demonstration and real-time performance requirements
NFR assessment: Cannot assess - no implementation to evaluate

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Story not ready for QA review
- Story should remain in Draft status until implementation is complete
- Critical for demonstrating value during user planning sessions
- Dependencies on conversation history and agent outputs from other Epic 2 stories
- All 7 acceptance criteria require implementation before QA review
- Real-time performance requirements need careful optimization
