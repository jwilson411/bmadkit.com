1. JWT-based authentication system implemented with secure token generation
2. User registration with email validation functionality
3. Login/logout functionality with proper session management
4. Password reset capability via email

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]

**Authentication Technologies:**
- **Authentication:** JWT + Passport 0.7.0 / 0.6.0 - Stateless tokens, mature ecosystem, Stripe integration ready
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt for secure password storage
- **Validation:** Zod 3.22.4 for runtime type validation
- **Email Service:** To be configured for email validation and password reset

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]

**User Entity:**
```typescript
User {
  id: UUID - Unique identifier
  email: String - Primary authentication credential  
  password_hash: String - Secure password storage
  subscription_tier: Enum - FREE, EMAIL_CAPTURED, PREMIUM
  stripe_customer_id: String? - Payment integration reference
  created_at: DateTime - Account creation timestamp
  last_login: DateTime? - Session tracking
  preferences: JSON - User planning preferences and history
}
```

**Relationships:**
- Has many PlanningSession entities
- Has many Document entities through sessions
- Has one UserProfile entity

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Security]

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- **Auth Method:** JWT tokens with RS256 signing
- **Session Management:** Stateless JWT with Redis blacklisting for logout
- **Required Patterns:**
  - All protected routes require valid JWT
  - Subscription tier validation for premium features

**Input Validation:**
- All external inputs MUST be validated
- Validation at API boundary before processing
- Whitelist approach preferred over blacklist

### API Endpoints Required
[Source: architecture.md#REST API Spec]

```yaml
/auth/register:
  - POST: User registration with email validation
/auth/login:
  - POST: Authentication with JWT token generation  
/auth/logout:
  - POST: Token invalidation
/auth/forgot-password:
  - POST: Password reset initiation
/auth/reset-password:
  - POST: Password reset completion
/auth/validate:
  - GET: Token validation middleware for protected routes
/auth/profile:
  - GET/PUT: User profile CRUD operations
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Strong authentication system design with comprehensive security considerations. The story properly implements stateless JWT authentication with secure token management, includes proper password hashing, and establishes solid middleware protection. The integration with subscription tiers and Stripe preparation shows forward-thinking design. Security practices are well-established with bcrypt, rate limiting, and token blacklisting.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - this is a specification-only story requiring implementation.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript and security best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Aligns with monorepo architecture specifications
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage planned
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria properly addressed with detailed implementation

### Improvements Checklist

[Items for developer consideration during implementation]

- [ ] Consider adding token rotation strategy for enhanced security
- [ ] Add account lockout mechanism after repeated failed login attempts
- [ ] Include security penetration testing for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Consider 2FA/MFA framework preparation for future enhancement
- [ ] Add load testing for authentication under high concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Include comprehensive token expiration edge case testing

### Security Review

Excellent security foundation with JWT RS256 signing, bcrypt password hashing, Redis token blacklisting, rate limiting, and proper input validation. Authentication middleware properly protects routes with subscription tier validation. Password reset includes secure temporary tokens with appropriate expiration.

### Performance Considerations

Good performance design with stateless JWT tokens reducing server memory, Redis for fast token blacklisting, and proper rate limiting. Authentication middleware efficiently validates requests without database hits after token verification.

### Files Modified During Review

None - specification review only.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-user-authentication-system.yml
Risk profile: Medium-risk security-critical component requiring careful implementation
NFR assessment: Strong security design with minor enhancement opportunities

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Development - Solid security foundation with enhancement recommendations
