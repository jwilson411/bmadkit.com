# Story 3.1: Real-time Document Streaming Interface

**Status:** Draft  
**Epic:** 3 - Planning Theater Experience  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Critical  

## Story

As a user,  
I want to watch my planning documents build in real-time as I answer questions,  
so that I can see the immediate value being created during our conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Split-screen interface with conversation panel and live document preview panel
2. WebSocket-powered real-time document updates without page refresh
3. Document sections appearing and updating as agents complete their work
4. Smooth scrolling and highlighting of newly generated content
5. Document formatting with proper markdown rendering and styling
6. Multi-document tabbed interface (Project Brief, PRD, Architecture, etc.)
7. Responsive layout that works effectively on desktop and tablet devices

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Pre-Implementation Review**: Story is in Draft phase with no implementation code to assess. This review focuses on requirements analysis, risk assessment, and architectural considerations for the real-time document streaming interface.

**Architecture Assessment**: The story defines a complex real-time system with WebSocket integration, responsive UI, and multi-document management. The technical approach using React 18+, Socket.IO, and Redux Toolkit is sound, but critical technical specifications are missing.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as no implementation code exists.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [N/A] No implementation to assess
- Project Structure: [✓] File structure clearly defined in story
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Testing approach lacks detail for WebSocket and real-time components
- All ACs Met: [✗] No implementation exists

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues Requiring Address Before Implementation:**

- [ ] Define WebSocket security specifications (authentication, rate limiting, CORS)
- [ ] Specify performance requirements (update latency, concurrent users, document size limits)
- [ ] Detail error handling for WebSocket disconnections and failures
- [ ] Clarify mobile UX for split-screen to single-panel transition
- [ ] Define accessibility requirements for dynamic content updates
- [ ] Specify data synchronization conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Add real-time content validation and sanitization requirements

**Testing Strategy Gaps:**

- [ ] WebSocket connection resilience testing strategy undefined
- [ ] Real-time performance benchmarking criteria missing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing approach not specified
- [ ] Load testing requirements for concurrent document streaming undefined

### Security Review

**Critical Security Gaps Identified:**
- WebSocket authentication and authorization mechanisms not specified
- Real-time content validation and XSS prevention not addressed  
- Rate limiting and DOS protection for WebSocket connections missing
- CORS and CSP requirements for Socket.IO integration undefined

### Performance Considerations

**High-Risk Performance Issues:**
- Document size limits and memory management strategy not defined
- WebSocket message batching and throttling requirements missing
- Client-side rendering performance for large documents not addressed
- Network optimization for real-time updates not specified

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified as no implementation exists.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/3.1-real-time-document-streaming-interface.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to complex real-time architecture without implementation
NFR assessment: Multiple NFR failures due to incomplete specifications

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - Story cannot proceed to implementation without addressing critical security, performance, and technical specification gaps]

**Next Steps:**
1. Technical specifications review with architecture team
2. Security requirements definition for WebSocket implementation
3. Performance benchmarking criteria establishment
4. Detailed testing strategy creation for real-time components
