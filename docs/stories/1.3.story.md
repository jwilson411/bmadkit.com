## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]

**Real-time Technologies:**
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO 4.7.4 - Automatic fallback support, room management, excellent Node.js integration
- **Message Queue:** Bull Queue 4.12.2 - Redis-based, perfect for orchestrating agent workflows, retry logic
- **Caching:** Redis 7.2 - In-memory performance for 45-minute sessions, pub/sub for real-time features

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture.md#Architectural and Design Patterns]

**Event-Driven Architecture:** Services communicate via events for loose coupling, using message queues for async processing - Supports real-time document updates, agent handoffs, and system resilience required for 45-minute sessions with 99.9% uptime

### Service Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Components]

**Real-time Streaming Service:**
- **Responsibility:** WebSocket server providing live document updates and progress notifications to connected clients
- **Key Interfaces:**
  - WebSocket `/ws/sessions/{sessionId}` - Real-time session connection
  - Events: `document_updated`, `agent_status_changed`, `progress_updated`
  - `/internal/broadcast` - Internal message broadcasting API
- **Dependencies:** Session Service, Redis pub/sub for message distribution
- **Technology Stack:** Socket.IO server, Redis adapter for horizontal scaling, Express.js health endpoints

### Event Types Required
[Source: architecture.md#Core Workflows]

**Real-time Events:**
1. **progress_updated** - Session completion progress
2. **document_updated** - Live document generation updates
3. **agent_status_changed** - Current agent working status
4. **session_started** - Planning session initiation
5. **session_completed** - Planning session completion
6. **error_occurred** - Error notifications with recovery guidance

### Session Management Integration
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]

**PlanningSession Model Integration:**
- session_id: UUID - Connect WebSocket rooms to database sessions
- status: Enum - ACTIVE, PAUSED, COMPLETED, FAILED
- current_agent: Enum - ANALYST, PM, UX_EXPERT, ARCHITECT
- progress_percentage: Integer - Real-time progress tracking
