# Story 2.3: Session State Management

**Status:** Complete  
**Epic:** 2 - Agent Orchestration Engine  
**Story Points:** 6  
**Priority:** High  

## Story

As a user,  
I want my planning session to remember our conversation and progress,  
so that I can pause, resume, and revise answers during the planning process.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Session creation and management with unique session identifiers
2. Conversation history storage in Redis cache with PostgreSQL backup
3. Current agent state tracking (analyst, PM, UX expert, architect)
4. User response storage with ability to revise previous answers
5. Session expiration and cleanup policies
6. Session resumption from any point in the workflow
7. Conversation context management within LLM token limits

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**MAJOR FINDING:** This story is currently in Draft status with no implementation present. The expected packages/api/src/ structure, Prisma models, and Redis/PostgreSQL integration outlined in the story do not exist. This is critical session management functionality for the 45-minute planning session requirement.

**Story Readiness:** Comprehensive requirements and detailed task breakdown exist, but missing:
- Session management service implementations
- Prisma data models for PlanningSession and ConversationMessage
- Redis caching and PostgreSQL backup implementation
- File List section documenting completed work
- Status update to "Review"

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as no implementation code exists.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⚠️ Cannot assess - no code exists
- Project Structure: ⚠️ Expected session service structure not implemented
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ No tests exist to evaluate
- All ACs Met: ✗ No implementation to verify against ACs

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage Gaps:**
- AC1: Session creation and management - No session-manager.ts service exists
- AC2: Dual storage (Redis/PostgreSQL) - No caching or database integration implemented
- AC3: Agent state tracking - No current agent state persistence code
- AC4: User response storage - No response revision functionality exists
- AC5: Session expiration and cleanup - No cleanup service or policies implemented
- AC6: Session resumption - No state restoration logic exists
- AC7: Token limit management - No conversation context optimization implemented

**Critical Risk Assessment:**
- **DATA LOSS RISK:** No session persistence threatens 45-minute session requirement
- **MEMORY LEAK RISK:** No cleanup policies could cause Redis memory exhaustion
- **CONCURRENCY RISK:** No session locking could cause data corruption
- **SCALABILITY RISK:** Dual storage synchronization complexity not addressed
- **TOKEN COST RISK:** No context management could lead to expensive LLM calls

### Security Review

**Critical Security Concerns:**
- No session ownership validation or access controls implemented
- Session data potentially contains sensitive user information without protection
- Redis session cache lacks authentication and encryption in transit
- No session hijacking protection or secure session identifier generation
- Conversation message storage lacks data sanitization and validation

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Risks Identified:**
- Dual storage write overhead not measured or optimized
- Session cache invalidation strategy could impact performance
- Large conversation histories may exceed memory limits
- Token limit management overhead not quantified
- Concurrent session access patterns not optimized

### Files Modified During Review

None - no implementation files exist.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.3-session-state-management.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to data loss and security concerns in session handling
NFR assessment: Cannot assess - no implementation to evaluate

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Story not ready for QA review
- Story should remain in Draft status until implementation is complete
- Critical dependency for all user interaction and state preservation
- Dual storage implementation requires careful design for data consistency
- All 7 acceptance criteria need implementation before QA review
