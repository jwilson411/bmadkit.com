# Story 3.2: AI Team Status Updates

**Status:** Draft  
**Epic:** 3 - Planning Theater Experience  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  

## Story

As a user,  
I want to see status updates about what my AI team is working on,  
so that I feel like I'm managing a real consulting team rather than using a tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Contextual status messages like "Your AI Project Manager is analyzing market positioning..."
2. Agent transition notifications that explain handoffs between specialists
3. Progress indicators showing completion of major planning phases
4. Estimated time remaining based on conversation progress and typical session length
5. "Team working" animations and visual feedback during LLM processing
6. Status message library that adapts to project type and current agent focus
7. Status persistence and recovery if user refreshes or reconnects
