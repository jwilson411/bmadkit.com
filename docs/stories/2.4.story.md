# Story 2.4: Agent Workflow Orchestration

**Status:** Draft  
**Epic:** 2 - Agent Orchestration Engine  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Critical  

## Story

As a user,  
I want to be guided through intelligent questions by different AI experts,  
so that I receive comprehensive planning without knowing the underlying methodology.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Workflow engine implementing greenfield-fullstack.yaml sequence (analyst → PM → UX expert → architect)
2. Agent transition logic that passes context between specialized agents
3. Dynamic question generation based on user responses and current agent
4. Conversation flow management ensuring logical progression
5. Agent handoff prompts that maintain context and conversation quality
6. Workflow state persistence and recovery on system restart
7. Agent workflow testing and validation capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]

**Orchestrator Pattern Implementation:**
- Central orchestration service managing complex BMAD agent workflows
- State machine pattern for agent transitions and conversation flow
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling between agents
- Message queue integration for async processing and reliability

### Workflow Definition
[Source: PRD Epic 2 requirements]

**Agent Sequence:** Analyst → PM → UX Expert → Architect
- **Analyst Phase:** Business analysis, market validation, requirements gathering
- **PM Phase:** Feature prioritization, user stories, project scope refinement
- **UX Expert Phase:** User experience design, interface planning, usability requirements
- **Architect Phase:** Technical architecture, implementation planning, technology selection

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**MAJOR FINDING:** This story is currently in Draft status with no implementation code present. This is the core orchestration engine (Priority: Critical) that coordinates the entire BMAD methodology flow from analyst → PM → UX expert → architect. The expected packages/api/src/ structure with workflow services and agent implementations does not exist.

**Story Readiness:** Extremely detailed requirements with comprehensive task breakdown exist, but missing:
- Workflow orchestration engine implementation
- State machine for agent transitions
- Individual agent implementations (analyst, PM, UX expert, architect)
- Context management and handoff logic
- File List section documenting completed work
- Status update to "Review"

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as no implementation code exists.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⚠️ Cannot assess - no code exists
- Project Structure: ⚠️ Expected workflow orchestration structure not implemented
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ No tests exist to evaluate
- All ACs Met: ✗ No implementation to verify against ACs

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage Gaps:**
- AC1: Workflow engine implementing greenfield-fullstack sequence - No orchestrator service exists
- AC2: Agent transition logic with context passing - No agent-coordinator.ts implemented
- AC3: Dynamic question generation - No context-aware questioning system exists
- AC4: Conversation flow management - No conversation-flow.ts service implemented
- AC5: Agent handoff prompts - No handoff mechanism or templates exist
- AC6: Workflow state persistence - No state persistence or recovery logic exists
- AC7: Agent workflow testing - No validation framework implemented

**Critical Risk Assessment:**
- **CRITICAL RISK:** Core orchestration missing - entire platform functionality depends on this
- **USER EXPERIENCE RISK:** No agent transition logic threatens seamless user journey
- **COMPLEXITY RISK:** State machine and context management are highly complex implementations
- **INTEGRATION RISK:** Dependencies on Stories 2.1 (agent prompts) and 2.2 (LLM gateway)
- **PERFORMANCE RISK:** Agent transition latency not addressed for smooth UX

### Security Review

**Critical Security Concerns:**
- Agent context passing could expose sensitive user data between agents
- Workflow state persistence needs secure storage for user planning data
- Agent prompt execution lacks input sanitization and validation
- No authorization controls for workflow execution and state access
- Dynamic question generation could be exploited for prompt injection

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Risks Identified:**
- Agent transition latency critical for user experience continuity
- Workflow state serialization/deserialization overhead not quantified
- Concurrent workflow execution scalability not addressed
- Context management memory usage with large planning sessions
- Dynamic question generation computational cost not measured

### Files Modified During Review

None - no implementation files exist.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.4-agent-workflow-orchestration.yml
Risk profile: Critical risk due to missing core orchestration functionality
NFR assessment: Cannot assess - no implementation to evaluate

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Story not ready for QA review
- Story should remain in Draft status until implementation is complete
- This is the highest priority Epic 2 story - core platform functionality
- Dependencies on Stories 2.1 and 2.2 must be resolved first
- All 7 acceptance criteria require implementation before QA review
- State machine complexity requires careful architectural design
