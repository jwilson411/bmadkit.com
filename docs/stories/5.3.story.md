## Story

As a user,  
I want the platform to gracefully handle errors and recover my session,  
so that technical issues don't cause me to lose planning progress or experience frustration.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. LLM API failure handling with automatic retry logic and fallback provider switching
3. Session recovery mechanisms that restore conversation state after connection interruptions
4. User-friendly error messages with clear next steps and support contact information

7. Data integrity validation ensuring planning documents remain consistent during errors

## Dev Notes

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- **Retry Policy:** Exponential backoff with jitter, max 3 retries
- **Circuit Breaker:** 50% failure rate threshold, 30-second timeout
- **Timeout Configuration:** 30s for LLM requests, 10s for other APIs
- **Error Translation:** Map external errors to user-friendly messages

**Error Model:**
- Structured error responses with correlation IDs
- Exception hierarchy: ApiError → BusinessLogicError, ValidationError, ExternalServiceError
- Fail-fast for critical errors, graceful degradation for non-critical services

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]

**Error Handling Technologies:**
- **Frontend Error Boundaries:** React Error Boundary components
- **Backend Error Handling:** Winston logging with structured error tracking
- **Retry Logic:** Custom exponential backoff implementation
- **Circuit Breaker:** Custom circuit breaker pattern for external APIs

### Security Review

**Error Handling Security Concerns:**
- Error messages must not expose sensitive system information or internal architecture
- Session backup data requires encryption and secure storage with access controls
- Offline mode data storage must prevent unauthorized access and data leakage
- Error reporting to external services (monitoring) requires PII sanitization

**Recommendations:**
- Implement error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- Add secure session backup with end-to-end encryption and key management
- Create offline data encryption with device-specific security measures
- Design error context collection with automatic PII detection and removal

### Performance Considerations

**Error Handling Performance Impact:**
- Error boundary processing must not degrade application performance during normal operation
- Session backup overhead must be minimized through efficient change detection
- Offline mode synchronization must not impact online performance
- Error recovery mechanisms must complete within acceptable time limits

**Critical Performance Requirements:**
- Error boundary overhead <1ms for normal operation
- Session backup latency <500ms for user interactions
- Error recovery completion <5 seconds for user-facing operations
- Offline sync performance must not block user interface responsiveness

**Reliability Engineering Considerations:**
- Error handling systems must be more reliable than the systems they protect
- Recovery mechanisms must handle cascading failures and dependency cycles
- Data integrity validation must not create performance bottlenecks
- Session recovery must handle partial failures and incomplete state
